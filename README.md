# Lexisg-frontend-intern-test

This project is a minimal frontend interface for a Lexi-like legal assistant, created as a solution for the Lexi Frontend Assignment. The application allows users to ask a legal question, receive a generated answer, and view citations from relevant documents.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Chat-like Interface**: A user-friendly, chat-based UI for a natural and intuitive user experience.
-   **Simulated API Interaction**: Demonstrates frontend-backend communication with a mock API, showcasing how to handle asynchronous data fetching and loading states.
-   **Interactive Citations**: Each generated answer includes a clickable citation that opens the source PDF in a new tab, allowing users to verify the information.
-   **Responsive Design**: The interface is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## üìÇ How Citation Linking Was Handled

The citation linking is managed within the main component through a simulated API call. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the process:

1.  **Simulated API Response**: The `simulateApiCall` function returns a promise that resolves with a mock API response containing the answer and an array of citations. Each citation object includes the text, the source file name, and a direct link to the PDF document.
    ```javascript
    const response = {
      answer: "Yes, under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988...",
      citations: [
        {
          text: "As the age of the deceased at the time of accident was held to be about 54‚Äì55 years...",
          source: "Dani_Devi_v_Pritam_Singh.pdf",
          link: "[https://lexisingapore-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/harshit_lexi_sg/EdOegeiR_gdBvQxdyW4xE6oBCDgj5E4Bo5wjvhPHpqgIuQ?e=TEu4vz](https://lexisingapore-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/harshit_lexi_sg/EdOegeiR_gdBvQxdyW4xE6oBCDgj5E4Bo5wjvhPHpqgIuQ?e=TEu4vz)"
        }
      ]
    };
    ```
2.  **Rendering Citations**: The UI maps over the `citations` array and renders each citation within the bot's message bubble.
3.  **Clickable Link**: Each citation is rendered as an `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute is set to the `link` from the citation object. `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` are used to open the PDF in a new tab for security and a better user experience.
    ```jsx
    <a
      href={citation.link}
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      className="mt-3 flex items-center gap-2 text-indigo-400 hover:text-indigo-300 text-sm font-medium transition-colors"
    >
      <LuFileText size={16} />
      <span>{citation.source}</span>
    </a>
    ```
4.  **Bonus: Scrolling and Highlighting**: While the current implementation opens the PDF in a new tab, a more advanced solution for scrolling to a specific paragraph could be achieved by appending a hash fragment to the URL (e.g., `#page=2&highlight=...`), provided the PDF viewer supports it. This project keeps it simple by linking directly to the document.
